## Diet optimization 

## Packet routing 

With $a_i$ the capacity consumed by $i-$th packet , $c_{i1}$ cost consumed by the $i-$th packet on link 1, $k_1$ and $k_2$ the constraints on each link and $x_i$ decision variables.


$$\begin{array}{cl}
\text{min} \space \sum_{i \in I} c_{i 1} x_i+c_{i 2}\left(1-x_i\right) & \text { (cost) } \\
\sum_{i \in I} a_i x_i \leq k_1 & \text { (capacity 1) } \\
\sum_{i \in I} a_i\left(1-x_i\right) \leq k_2 & \text { (capacity 2) } \\
\quad x_i \in\{0,1\}, i \in I & \text { (binary variables) }
\end{array}$$

We can also 'expand' this formulation obviously for many links. In that case the decision variables will be $x_{ij}$ : set to 1 if packet $i-$th is sent over $j-$th link. 
Also remember to explicit the constraint: $\sum_ j ^ {\text{\# links}} x_ij = 1$ which in case of 2 links was kept 'implicit'.
