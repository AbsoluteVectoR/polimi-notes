# Introductions

In computer science and operations research, **exact algorithms** are algorithms that always solve an optimization problem to optimality. But before actually select and develop an algorithm we have to define the problem and build a modelling. 

## How we model optimization problems

### Decisional Variables 

We define decisional variables that represent ''what we decide'' in order to optimize the problem. They can be integer/float/binary(bool). 


### Constraints 

In **linear** programming we will always have **linear** constraints. Constraints are equations or inequations. We can transform constraints using **slack** variables. 

$$x \ge 0 \text{ can become } x + s = 0 \text{ with } s \ge 0$$

Binary/logical/boolean transformations: 

$$\begin{aligned}
& \neg  x = 1-x \\
&x \text { xor } y \rightarrow x+y \le 1 \\
&x \text { or } y \rightarrow x+y \ge 1 \\
&x \text { and } y \rightarrow x \ge 1 , y \ge 1   \\
&x \Rightarrow y \ge 1, y \ge x \\
&x \leftrightarrow y \ge x=y \\
\end{aligned}$$

### Objective Function 

A function with the decisional variables. We will try to optimize it. $$\min (f(x)) =  \max (-f(x)) $$
