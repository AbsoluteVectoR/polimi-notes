## Scheduling

In order to achieve higher performance from a given architecture, it is necessary to extract more parallelism from programs. This is done by detecting and solving dependencies between instructions, and scheduling them in a way that maximizes parallel execution within the available resources. Dependences among instructions are crucial for determining the amount of parallelism in a program, and if two instructions are dependent, they cannot be executed in parallel and must be executed in order or partially overlapped. Three different types of dependences:

* Name Dependences: Name dependence occurs when 2 instructions use the same register or memory location (called name), but there is no flow of data between the instructions associated with that name.
* Data Dependences (or True Data Dependences): RAW, WAW, or WAR. The actual hazard and the number of stalls to eliminate the hazards are a property of the pipeline.
* Control Dependences

It's obvious, but remember that dependencies are properties of the program.
