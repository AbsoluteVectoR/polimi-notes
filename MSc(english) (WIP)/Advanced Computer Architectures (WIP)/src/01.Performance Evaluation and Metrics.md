$$IC= \text{\# instructions}$$

$$CPI=\frac{\text{CC}}{\text{IC}}=\frac{\text{clock cycle}}{\text{\# instructions}}$$

$$MIPS=\frac{\text{clock frequency}}{CPI^*10^6}$$

**Ahmdal's law** , this doesn't tell anything on the performance of the CPU still depends on its frequency. 

$$\text{SPEED UP}=SU=\frac{1}{1 - \text{(fraction enhanced)} + ( \frac{\text{fraction enhanced} }{SU_{\text{fraction enhanced}}})}$$

**Gustafson law** revises it:

$$SU_{GUS}=\frac{1}{\text{sequential} + \frac{\text{parallel}}{N}}$$
