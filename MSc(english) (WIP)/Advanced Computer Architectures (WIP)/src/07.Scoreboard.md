## Dynamic Scheduling intro

Two strategies to support ILP: Static and **Dynamic Scheduling**. Dynamic Scheduling depends on the hardware to locate parallelism. The hardware reorders the instruction execution to reduce pipeline stalls while maintaining data flow and exception behavior. Main advantages:

- It enables handling cases where dependences are unknown at compile time
- It simplifies the compiler complexity
- It allows compiled code to run efficiently on a different pipeline.

Those advantages are gained at a cost:

- More HW complexity
- Increased power consumption
- Could generate imprecise exception


"If an instruction is stalled in the IS stage, it implies that it has entered the issue stage and is causing a WAR problem. During exams, it's preferred to write "I" when an instruction enters the issue stage. The method of stalling IS is only used for RAW data dependencies. Stalling for every RAW in D can prevent the pipeline from executing other instructions, thus it's better to stall for WAR and WAW name dependencies only."

## Scoreboard 

The CDC 6600 introduced the first scoreboard in 1964.

### Scoreboard main features

- complex pipeline with "ISSUE"
- In order issued
- out of order execution
- out of order committed (writebacked)
- no forwarding
- control is centralized into the **Scoreboard**

Scoreboard data structure tracks functional unit status and register result status:

- `busy` indicating unit status
- `Op` for operation type
- `Fi` for destination register
- `Fj` and `Fk` for source registers
- `Qj` and `Qk` for the FUs outputting the source registers
- `Rj` and `Rk` for flags indicating if the `Fj` and `Fk` registers are ready.

### Four Logical Stages of Scoreboard Control

- Issue
- Read Operands 
- Execution completion 
- Writeback

### What to remember in Scoreboard

- **Stalling ISSUE** stage is used to avoid **WAW** and structural hazards
- **Stalling Read Operands** stage is used to avoid **RAW** hazards.
- Exe is never stalled
- **Stalling WB** if a **WAR** is detected.

### Simplified view

| ISSUE | READ OPERAND | EXE COMPLETE | WB |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Decode instruction | Read operands | Operate on operands | Finish exec |
| Structural FUs check WAW checks | WAR if need to read RAW check | Notify Scoreboard on Completion | WAR and **Struct check** (FUs will hold results) Can overlap issue/read\write 4 Structural Hazard; |


Example

- te that you start counting the decrease of the clock latency used by operations from the reading operands )


- For issuing, the add operation must wait for the mult operation to finish reading operands.

|  | Issue | Read Op | Exec Co. | Write R. |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| LD F6 32+ R2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| LD F2 45+ R3 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| MULTD F0 F4 F2 | 6 | 9 | 19 | 20 |
| ADD F2 F8 F6 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |
| DIVD F12 F0 F6 | 10 | 21 | 31 | 32 |
| SUBD F6 F8 F2 | 11 | 13 | 14 | 22 |


## Scoreboard with renaming

### Register renaming from wikipedia: 

```c
r1 = m[1024]
r1 = r1 + 2
m[1032] = r1
r1 = m[2048]
r1 = r1 + 4
m[2056] = r1
```

The instructions in the final three lines are independent of the first three instructions, but the processor cannot finish `r1 = m[2048]` until the preceding `m[1032] = r1` is done.
This restriction is eliminated by changing the names of some of the registers:

```c
r1 = m[1024]
r1 = r1 + 2
m[1032] = r1
r2 = m[2048]
r2 = r2 + 4
m[2056] = r2
```

In addition to eliminating data dependencies between instructions, register renaming provides several other advantages: it allows for speculative execution, stalls reduction, instruction scheduling semplification and reduction of explicit load and store operations. 


Just a convention in the exercises. 
While you are checking for RAW hazards if there is between I1-I3, I2-I3 on the same register, you only consider the raw from with the last WRITE so in this case you will only report I2-I3 and not I1-I3 or others previous writes.


| ISSUE | READ OPERAND | EXE COMPLETE | WB |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\begin{array}{c}\text { Decode } \\\text { instruction; } \\\text { allocate new } \\\text { physical register } \\\text { for result }\end{array}$ | Read operands; | Operate on operands; | Finish exec; |
| $\begin{array}{c}\text { Structural FUs } \\\text { check; } \\\text { WAW-checks; } \\\text { free physical } \\\text { registers check }\end{array}$ | $\begin{array}{c}\text { RAW check; } \\\text { WAR if need to-read }\end{array}$ | $\begin{array}{c}\text { Notify Scoreboard on } \\\text { completion; }\end{array}$ | $\begin{array}{c}\text { WAR \& Struct check } \\\text { (FUs will hold results); } \\\text { Can overlap } \\\text { issue/read\&write; }\end{array}$ |


- **register renaming** is a technique that abstracts logical registers from physical registers. Every logical register has a set of physical registers associated with it.
- Register Renaming allows to avoid WAR and WAW hazards
- The concept explained in spaghettata mode: "I'm a FU and I'm waiting for an operand which is used atm by another FU. I can **abstract** over the register and use something like a **pointer**"
