* **Dynamic Scheduling**: Depend on the hardware to locate parallelism. The hardware reorders the instruction execution to reduce pipeline stalls while maintaining data flow and exception behavior. Main advantages:
    * It enables handling some cases where dependences are unknown at compile time
    * It simplifies the compiler complexity
    * It allows compiled code to run efficiently on a different pipeline.
    Those advantages are gained at a cost:
    * A significant increase in hardware complexity
    * Increased power consumption
    * Could generate imprecise exception



"If an instruction is stalled in the IS stage, it implies that it has entered the issue stage and is causing a WAR problem. During exams, it's preferred to write "I" when an instruction enters the issue stage. The method of stalling IS is only used for RAW data dependencies. Stalling for every RAW in D can prevent the pipeline from executing other instructions, thus it's better to stall for WAR and WAW name dependencies only."


This hashmap (which index is the FU) is called functional unit status

and works with an additional array of signals the status of all

registers, the register result status.

  

  

  

  

Scoreboard - The Algorithm

  

complex pipeline with "ISSUE"

  

In order issued

  

out of order executed

  

out of order committed (writebacked)

  

  

Stalling ISSUE is

used to avoid WAW and structural hazards

  

Read operands stage is stalled in order to avoid RAW hazards.

  

  

Exe canÂ´t be stalled

  

WB can be stalled if a WAR is

detected.

  


# Scoreboard

In superscalar architectures, the hardware dynamically schedules instructions from a single program flow based on their availability and dependencies. The processor fetches multiple instructions at once and uses sophisticated logic to identify independent operations that can be executed in parallel by different functional units. This requires more complex hardware than VLIW processors but allows for better utilization of resources since only independent operations are executed concurrently.

: Depend on the hardware to locate parallelism

Problem: data dependences that cannot be hidden with bypassing or forwarding cause hardware stalls of the pipeline

allow instructions behind a stall to proceed

HW rearranges the instruction execution to reduce stalls

Enables out-of-order execution and completion (commit)

Out-of order execution introduces possibility of WAR, WAW data hazards.

Suppose a data structure keeps track of all the instructions in all the functional units


### Scoreboard 

- in-order issue
- out-of-order read operands
- out-of-order execution
- out-of-order completion
- no forwarding
- Control is centralized into the Scoreboard

Simpliefied view: 


| ISSUE | READ OPERAND | EXE COMPLETE | WB |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Decode instruction; | Read operands; | Operate on operands; | Finish exec; |
| Structural FUs check; WAW checks | WAR if need to read RAW check; | Notify Scoreboard on Completion; | WAR \&Struct check (FUs will hold results); Can overlap issue/read\&write 4 Structural Hazard; |




A SCOREBOARD: A Data Structure for Correct Issues Keeps track of the status of Functional Units.

CDC6600 Scoreboard: Introduced in the CDC 6600 (the world's fastest computer from 1964 to 1969)

Four Stages of Scoreboard Control

The ID stage is divide into:

* Issue: decode and check structural hazard
* Read Operands: wait until no data hazards

In-order issue BUT out-of-order read-operands

So imagine if three issues execution writing (commiting) ...
all our architectures are in order issues

The crucial idea: preserved the order of the issues (instructions) but each instructions read the operands out of order. When the source operands are available, the scoreboard tells the functional unit to proceed to read the operands from the registers and begin execution. RAW hazards are resolved dynamically in this step, and instructions may be sent into execution out of order.

Issue: Decode instructions & check for structural hazards. Instructions read the operands in an out of order way.

* Instructions issued in program order (for hazard checking)
* If a functional unit for the instruction is free and no other active instruction has the same destination register (WAW), the scoreboard issues the instruction to the functional unit and updates its internal data structure.
* If a structural or a WAW hazard exists, then the instruction issue stalls, and no further instructions will issue until these hazards are cleared.

Read operands: Wait until no data hazards, then read operands. An operand can be used as a source operand if:

* No active instruction, which was issued earlier, will write it.
* A functional unit is currently writing its value in a register.

The third phase is the execution. FUs are characterized by **latency** (the effective time used to complete one operation) and the **initiation interval** (the number of cycles that must elapse between issuing two operations to the same functional unit).

4th stage: once the scoreboard is aware that the functional unit has completed execution, the scoreboard checks for **WAR** hazards. If none, it writes results. If WAR, then it stalls the instruction.
For example here

![](images/57ea7b646891977bab7f25ed11ed3677.png)

Here the scoreboard would stall `SUBD` in the `WB` stage, **at the end of the execution phase**.

Scoreboard keeps track of dependences and state of operations

So recap:

ISSUE (IN-ORDER): check for WAW
READ OPERANDS (OUT-OF-ORDER): RAW
WRITEBACK (OUT-OF-ORDER): WAR


War ???? 

## Scoreboard structure:




* Instruction status
Example (each numeber is the clock cycle)

| Instruction |  | j | k | Issue | Read Operands | Exec Completion |Write Resul |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| LD | F6 | 34+ | R2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| LD | F2 | 45+ | R3 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| MULTD | F0 | F2 | F4 | 6 | 9 | 19 | 20 |
| SUBD | F8 | F6 | F2 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 12 |
| DIVD | F1 | F0 | F6 | 8 | 21 | 61 | 62 |
| ADDD | F6 | F8 | F2 | 13 | 14 | 16 | 22 |

In this case:

Integer: 1 clock cycles
Multi: 10 cc
Add: 2cc
Divide: 40cc


* Functional Unit status: we track only registers information ... if they are not registers but come from the memory is not a problem. 
    * `busy` indicating unit status
    * `Op` for operation type
    * `Fi` for destination register
    * `Fj` and `Fk` for source registers
    * `Qj` and `Qk` for the functional units outputting the source registers
    * `Rj` and `Rk` for flags indicating if the `Fj` and `Fk` registers are ready.
* Register result status: Indicates which functional unit will write each register. Blank if no pending instructions will write that register

(note that you start counting the decrease of the clock latency used by operations from the reading operands )


Workflow -> each functional unit has some latency which differs .. generally multiply is more than integer operations/loads and the divide is more than multiply. each instruction at Read Operands stage can be executed out of orders and each operation has to wait that the necessary registers are free

"The lecture is about advanced architectures, and we start by discussing the workflow. Each functional unit in a processor has a different latency, with multiplication taking longer than integer operations/loads and division taking longer than multiplication. Instructions can be executed out of order at the Read Operands stage, however, each operation must wait for the necessary registers to become free."


Everything is out of order except the Issue phase. 



You have to check the "pool" of function units. 


scoreboard with renaming: 

| ISSUE | READ OPERAND | EXE COMPLETE | WB |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\begin{array}{c}\text { Decode } \\\text { instruction; } \\\text { allocate new } \\\text { physical register } \\\text { for result }\end{array}$ | Read operands; | Operate on operands; | Finish exec; |
