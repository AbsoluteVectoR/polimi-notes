# Exceptions Handling

## Interrupts

Interrupts are signals that alter the normal control flow of a program at runtime. An **interrupt** must be handled by a dedicated **interrupt handler**, and the architecture should be able to resume the normal execution of the program.
Causes: 

- **Asynchronous** external events:
	- I/O device reply
	- timer expiration
	- HW failure
- **Synchronous** internal event:
	- opcode error
	- arithmetic overflow
	- bad memory access
	- traps: traps are a mechanism used by computers to transfer control to the OS or to kernel routines in response to various events like system calls.

**Interrupts** can be characterized in various ways:

- **Async** interrupts are caused by external sources and can be handled at the end of the execution of the current instruction, making them easier to manage than **sync** ones.
- **User request** interrupts are predictable: they are treated as exceptions because they use the same mechanism. **Coerced interrupts** are caused by some HW event not under control of the program.
- **User maskable** vs **user nonmaskable** ? 
- **Within instructions** interrupts are usually synchronous since the instruction triggers the exception. The instruction must be stopped and restarted.
- **Resume** vs **terminate** interrupts
- **Precise** interrupt/exception if it occurs at a designated interrupt point, where all previous instructions have fully committed their state and no following instructions have modified any state.
