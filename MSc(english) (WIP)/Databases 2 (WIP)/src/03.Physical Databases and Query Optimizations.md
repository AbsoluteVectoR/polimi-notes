# Physical Databases and Query Optimizations

Primary structure: it contains all the tuplesof a table
•
Main purpose: to store the table content
•
Secondary structures: are used to index primary structures, and only contain the values of some fields.


Three main types of data access structures:
- Sequential structures
- Hash-based structures
- Tree-based structures

$$\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline & \text { Primary } & \text { Secondary } \\
\hline \text { Sequential structures } & \text { Typical } & \text { Not used } \\
\hline \text { Hash-based structures } & \begin{array}{l}
\text { In some DBMSs (e.g., Oracle } \\
\text { hash clusters, IDM DB2 } \\
\text { "organize by hash" tables) }
\end{array} & \text { Frequent } \\
\hline \text { Tree-based structures } & \text { Obsolete/rare } & \text { Typical } \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Blocks: the "physical" components of files
•
Tuples: the "logical" components of tables
•
The size of a block is typically fixedand depends on the file system and on how the disk is formatted
•
The size of a tuple (also called record) depends on the database design and is typically variablewithin a file




Operations are performed in main memory and affect pages (in the buffer). 
Operations are:

- Insertion and update of a tuple
- Deletion of a tuple
- Access to a field of a particular tuple, which is identified according to an offset w.r.t. the beginning of the tuple and the length of the field itself (stored in the page dictionary). 


## Sequential structures


The default are not sorting data and it will never happen a shifting operation. 

Entry-sequenced sequential (a.k.a. heap) structure 
Effective for
•
Insertion, which does not require shifting
•
Space occupancy, as it uses all the blocks available for files and all the space within the blocks
•
Sequentialreading and writing (select * from T)
•
Especially if the disk blocks are contiguous (seek & latency times reduced)
•
Only if all (or most of) the file is to be accessed
•
Non-optimal for
•
Searching specific data units (select * from T where…)
•
may require scanning the whole structure
•
But with indexes can be used efficiently
•
Updates that increase the size of a tuple (“shifts” required)
•
Shift may require storage in another block
•
Alternative approach: delete old version and insert new one

$$\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}
\hline & \text { Entry-sequenced } & \text { Sequentially-ordered } \\
\hline \text { INSERT } & \text { Efficient } & \text { Not efficient } \\
\hline \text { UPDATE } & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Efficient (if data size } \\
\text { increases } \rightarrow \text { delete }+\text { insert } \\
\text { the new version) }
\end{array} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Not efficient if data size } \\
\text { increases }
\end{array} \\
\hline \begin{array}{l}
\text { DELETE }
\end{array} & \text { "Invalid" } & \text { "Invalid" } \\
\hline \text { TUPLE SIZE } & \text { Fixed or variable } & \text { Fixed or variable } \\
\hline \begin{array}{l}
\text { SELECT * FROM T } \\
\text { WHERE key } \ldots
\end{array} & \text { Not efficient } & \\
\hline
\end{array}$$


## Hash based structures

Good for point query and bad for range queries (because the lack of sorting). 

 I/O operations = 

statistical estimations 

The modern systems use statistics to choose between B+ systems or hash or sequential ones.

Ausiliary 

Don’t get confused:
•
Primary key: set of attributes that uniquely identify a tuple (minimal, unique, not null)
•
Does not imply access path
•
In SQL “PRIMARY KEY” defines a constraint
•
Implemented by means of an index
•
Search key: set of attributes used in an index to speed up tuple location
•
Physical implementation of access structures
•
Defines a common access path
•
Each search key value is associated with one or more pointers
•
May be unique (one p

$$\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\text { Type of Index } & \text { Type of structure } & \text { Search Key } & \text { Density } & \begin{array}{l}
\text { How } \\
\text { many }
\end{array} \\
\hline \text { Primary } & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Sequentially } \\
\text { ordered } \\
\text { with SK = OK }
\end{array} & \text { Unique } & \text { Dense or sparse } & \begin{array}{l}
\text { One per } \\
\text { table }
\end{array} \\
\hline \begin{array}{l}
\text { Secondary }
\end{array} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Entry sequenced } \\
\text { or Sequentially } \\
\text { ordered with SK } \\
\text { != OK }
\end{array} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Unique and } \\
\text { non unique }
\end{array} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Dense (not } \\
\text { possible to scan } \\
\text { primary data } \\
\text { structure wrt SK) }
\end{array} & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Many per } \\
\text { table }
\end{array} \\
\hline \text { Clustering } & \begin{array}{l}
\text { Sequentially } \\
\text { ordered with SK }= \\
\text { OK }
\end{array} & \text { Non unique } & \text { Typically sparse } & \begin{array}{l}
\text { One per } \\
\text { table }
\end{array} \\
\hline
\end{array}$$

Smaller than primary data structures, can be loaded in main memory
Support point/range queries and sorted scans efficiently
But less efficient that hash structures for point queries. BUT: adding indexes to tables means that the DBMS has to update the index too after an insert update or delete operation. Indexes do not come for free, they may slow down data changing operations.
