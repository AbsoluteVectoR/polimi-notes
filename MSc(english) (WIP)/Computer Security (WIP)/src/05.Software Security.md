# Software Security 

- Bug-free software does not exist. 
- Not all bugs lead to vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerabilities without a working exploit exist.
- Vulnerability-free software is difficult to achieve.

To minimize the window of exposure, the following steps should ideally be followed:

1. The vendor should find the vulnerability.
2. The vendor should patch the vulnerability.
3. The vulnerability should be disclosed.

### Example of vulnerabilities and exploiting in UNIX-like systems

- In UNIX, each file has an owner with specific privileges. When an executable is run, it spawns a process that runs under the **real user id** (**RUID**), which may not be the same as the owner. 
- The RUID determines the process security constraints while running. 
- The **effective user id** (**EUID**) is the user ID used for checking permissions and it's often equivalent to the RUID. 
- However it’s possible to change **EUID** at runtime, using the **saved user** id (**SUID**). If an attacker exploits a poorly written executable, they can leverage any security flaws to run processes under the **SUID** owner's security constraints, giving them root access. 

Managing permissions correctly is critical. Secure design demands:

- reducing privileged parts to a minimum
- keeping the program simple as possible
- discarding privileges as soon as possible
- employing open design
- avoiding untrusted libraries
- avoiding concurrency race conditions

## Buffer Overflow 

We will consider ELFs running on an 32-bit x86 architecture, but the concept is valid in any other OS or architecture.  
Buffer overflow caused overwrite of the saved $EIP$ (which contains the next instruction to execute) on stack due to lack of size checks. The corrupted return address can lead to various consequences: the program may crash, execute unexpected instructions or attackers can craft malicious payloads to take control of the program. 

> Proper input validation and size checks are necessary to avoid buffer overflows.

How to exploit this vulnerability? We have to jump to a valid memory address where there is a valid piece of code

The method is called _stack smashing_ : we place the code that we want to run directly inside of the buffer and rewrite the return address with the address of the buffer itself.

[Still a lot popular apps are affected by buffer overflows](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=buffer+overflow) . 


### Stack smashing

What we place on the buffer? A piece of assembly code and the address of the start of the buffer, so that we overwrite the $ESP$ and then the computer jumps to the code just written in the buffer. To obtain the assembly of a piece of code obviously we first need to write the program, compile it and then we disassemble it. 
But obtaining the precise address of the buffer can be challenging. However, we can estimate it by examining the value of ESP from a debugger. Due to the debugger's presence (different debuggers and different methodologies gives us different values, since the debugging variables are changing the offset of the variables inside the stack), the obtained value may not be entirely accurate, which makes it difficult to execute the code precisely. 
How to solve the problem of precision? We can insert a sequence of NOP instructions before our code, known as a _NOP sled_. The NOP sled allows us
