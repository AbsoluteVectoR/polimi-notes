# Web security 

The basic structure of a web app or website is based on HTTP(S) protocol. 
It's very important in this context to filter and validate client input carefully. Client is not always cooperative and may try to manipulate requests. Developers should not overlook this, since the client is the only part of the software that the attacker can use. 
It's common to assume that all the clients are attackers. 

## XSS - Cross Site Scripting

We can call XSS any stuff that can be exploited by the attacker to inject into a web page a script. There are three types from an higher point of view:

- **Stored XSS**: the attacker input is stored on the target server's database. This happens if the malicious code is not filtered out. 
- **Reflected XSS**: the malicious code is not stored on the server, it is simply in a response of the attacker to the users. This case it's different from the previous since it's necessary to fool the user in order to successfully complete the attack.
- **DOM-based XSS**: basically the previous one ... the only big difference is that the attack remains in the user's browser and the server doesn't see anything. 

TO FIX : 

Reflected XSS: We can append a parameter and a JavaScript script to a URL through a GET request. If the input is not sanitized, this can be dangerous because the script will be used as a parameter and can trigger an error page or load a generic page that includes the injected script. Since nothing is stored on the server, it is called reflected XSS


### XSS bypasses Same Origin Policy 

**SOP** is a paradigm which is based on the rule: 

> "all client-side code (e.g., JavaScript) loaded from origin **A** should only be able to access data from origin **A**"

where an origin is identified by the tuple: `<PROTOCOL,HOST,PORT`. It's easy to see that XSS bypass this simple rule and also in nowadays it's not rare that applications permits to share resources to enhance services. 
A solution could be to blackilist everything that may be misinterpreted but it's not a good approach. 

### CSP

**CSP3** (Content Security Policy) is the most valid defensive measure to mitigate XSS. It's a set of directives sent by the server to the client in the form of HTTP response headers which specifies what should be trusted and what shouldn't.
Many directives can be implemented, examples: 

- `script-src` load client code only from listed origins
- `form-action` lists valid endpoints for submission
- `frame-ancestors` lists sources that can embed the current page as frames and applets
- `img-src` defines the origins from which images can be loaded
- `style-src` as `script-src` but for stylesheets

CSP in theory is effective against XSS, but since the policies are written manually by devs and they must be to keep updated, they often are not effective to mitigate such attacks. 

## SQL Injection 

SQL injections can happen every time the input fields are not-sanitized input in web forms. Closing a string with the caracter `'` or the query injecting `;`, as well as commenting ( `--`) or using operators such as `UNION` and `INTERSECTION` can be exploited to bypass password checking or completely bypass the query system. 
Examples: 

````sql
SELECT name, phone, address FROM Users
WHERE Id='userinput'; 
````

can become: 

````sql
SELECT name, phone,address FROM Users
WHERE Id='' or '1'='1' ;--';
````
injecting `' or '1'='1' ;--` . 
Also `UNION` operator permits to concatenate the output of multiple queries, even a query on a different table from the original one. 

**SQL injection prevention**:

- properly sanitize input
- **not** build queries by string concatenation but using alternatives way 
- limit query privileges to limit damages 


## Cookies

The basic idea behind cookies is that the server stores small text file (a cookie) on user's browser which help to recognizes users when they visit website again but can also be used to track the same user across multiple websites. The cookie is also used to store sessions to avoid repeated logins, and this last aspect it's also a dangerous point of attack. 

Cookies were born to help web sites build a user experience that was
tailored to the *single client*. The abuse of the cookies (as nowadays
web) renders them a weapon of mass surveillance: every action can be
stored in a cookie on the client and then accessed to model the client
behaviour.


Cookies are used to store information about the HTTP *session*, a
technique used by websites to keep track of the state of an interaction
with a client. For example, to keep conversational data about a client,
the server can generate a SessionID that than stores as a cookie on the
client to identify it, and the data associated to it.\
OBVIOUSLY these session tokens should be crafted in a way to not be
exploitable:

-   if used for authentication, not storing plaintext sensible data

-   if used for session identification they should not be predictable
-  they should have a clear (and near) expiration date that ALSO should not coincide with the cookie one

All these things must be kept in mind when designing session interaction
in order to avoid impersonating attacks: if an attacker is able to spoof
sensitive infos from the cookies he can easily impersonate someone else.

Solution developed to make HTTP somewhat stateful. The basic idea is to have the web server store a small text file (containing an id or some preferences settings) on the browser of the user that visited the website in order to recognize it later.  
This idea was (and is) also abused to track a specific user across website (for instance, for advertisement purposed).  
Cookies are also used to store sessions for the users in order not to have them log in each time. This poses other problems because it can lead to sessions being stolen or created if the mechanism that builds the random tokens is predictable.

There are also issues with sessions that each developer needs to address:
- what to do in case of multiple concurrent sessions? (different tabs for example)
- when to invalidate sessions?
- how to keep track and store them on the server?
- how to handle an expired session?


### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Attack that forces the user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which he is currently authenticated using ambient credentials (e.g. cookies). See [here](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) for detailed info.  

Concepts:

- cookies are used to manage sessions
- all request originating from the browser carry the associated cookies --> cookies are ambient credentials: sent automatically at each request.
- malicious request are routed to the web application through the victim's browser (along with its credentials that are stored in the cookies).
- the web app cannot distinguish if the request came from the victim or it was forced by someone else

How are these attacks performed?

- create a malicious web page
- insert a form in the page that sends the request to the target website (e.g. bank website)
- when the user visit the malicious website the request is sent
- if the user was logged in then the request will go through as legitimate since its cookies were sent along with the request by the browser


A CSRF attack exploits cookies to force a user to execute unwanted actions on a web application. The attack involves four steps: 

1) victim signs in on a website using cookies 
2) victim visits a malicious site or clicks on a link
3) malicious site generates a fake request using XSS techniques
4) the victim's web client executes the malicious web request, tricking the original website's authentication by using ambient variables.


#### CSRF Mitigation Techniques


Use random tokens associated with each request and do not store them in cookies:

- the web page before sending the form inserts a random token, regenerated at each request
- when the user fills in the form, check that the random token is still there
- an attacker needs to guess the token to have the request go through (that's why we need it to be random)


CSRF attacks can be mitigated using different techniques, such as CSRF token and Same Site Cookies policy. CSRF token involves generating random tokens that are associated to the user's session, which are regenerated each time a request is made. The client sends the tokens to the server, and the requests are confirmed only if they match with the tokens stored on the server. Same Site Cookies policy works by setting an additional 'SameSite' attribute when the cookie is generated. The attribute instructs the browser to attach the cookie only to same-site requests, making CSRF ineffective. However, this technique requires browser recognition and implementation of the 'SameSite' attribute and the cookie to have the 'Secure' flag.


The CSRF-token is the value that needs to be random and changed at each request.

Another mitigation is to use Same-Site Cookies. Specify in the cookie that it should not be sent along a request if the request was generated from a different website than the one that set the cookie.
