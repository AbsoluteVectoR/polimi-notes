# Regular Expressions

Regular expression.

The family of REGULAR LANGUAGES is our simplest formal language family. It can be defined in three ways:

- Algebraically (we start from this)
- By means of generative grammars
- By means of recognizer automataa regular expression


a regular language is a language denoted by a regular expression


The family of REG is the collection of all regular languages. 
THE FAMILY OF FINITE LANGUAGES (FIN)It is the collection of all languages having a finite cardinalityEVERY FINITE LANGUAGE IS REGULAR (hence FINREG)because it is the union of a finite number of stringseach one being the concatention of a finite number of alphabet symbols


derivation relation can be applied repeatedly, yielding relation


POWER: $a^h=a a \ldots a(h$ times $): a^n$
REPETITION: from $k$ to $n>k:[a]_k^n=a^k \cup a^{k+1} \cup \ldots a^n$
OPTIONALITY: $(\varepsilon \cup a)$ or $[a]$
ORDERED INTERVAL: $(0 \ldots 9)(a \ldots z)(A \ldots Z)$


property: the REGfamily is closed underconcatenation, union, star. 

REGis also closed under INTERSECTION and COMPLEMENT.


### APPLICATION: REPRESENTATION OF LISTS BY MEANS OF R.E.

a list contains an unspecified number of elements e of the same type generated by the r.e. e+, or e* if it can be emptye can be a terminal symbol or any regular subexpression


## Regular Languages 

A language on an alphabet is regular if it can be defined by a regular expression. So only if it is defined by concatanation, union and star over the elementary languages of $L$ ($\{a_1\} , \{a_2\} , \{a_3\} \dots$). 

REG is the family of all regular languages (indipendently by the alphabet which each language is based on).
