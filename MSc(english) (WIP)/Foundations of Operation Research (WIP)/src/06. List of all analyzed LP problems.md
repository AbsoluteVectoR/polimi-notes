## Diet optimization 

## Packet routing 

With $a_i$ the capacity consumed by $i-$th packet , $c_{i1}$ cost consumed by the $i-$th packet on link 1, $k_1$ and $k_2$ the constraints on each link and $x_i$ decision variables.


$$\begin{array}{cl}
\text{min} \space \sum_{i \in I} c_{i 1} x_i+c_{i 2}\left(1-x_i\right) & \text { (cost) } \\
\sum_{i \in I} a_i x_i \leq k_1 & \text { (capacity 1) } \\
\sum_{i \in I} a_i\left(1-x_i\right) \leq k_2 & \text { (capacity 2) } \\
\quad x_i \in\{0,1\}, i \in I & \text { (binary variables) }
\end{array}$$

We can also 'expand' this formulation obviously for many links. In that case the decision variables will be $x_{ij}$ : set to 1 if packet $i-$th is sent over $j-$th link. 
Also remember to explicit the constraint: $\sum_ j ^ {\text{\# links}} x_ij = 1$ which in case of 2 links was kept 'implicit'.


1.  The Diet Problem: This is a classic LP problem that involves finding the optimal combination of foods to eat in order to meet certain nutritional requirements at the lowest cost.
    
2.  The Transportation Problem: This LP problem involves finding the optimal way to distribute a product from a set of sources to a set of destinations at the lowest cost.
    
3.  The Assignment Problem: This LP problem involves finding the optimal assignment of workers to tasks, in order to minimize the total cost of the assignments.
    
4.  The Production Planning Problem: This LP problem involves finding the optimal production levels of different products in order to maximize profits or minimize costs.
    
5.  The Portfolio Optimization Problem: This LP problem involves finding the optimal allocation of assets in a portfolio in order to maximize returns or minimize risk.
    
6.  The Resource Allocation Problem: This LP problem involves finding the optimal allocation of resources (such as time, money, or materials) to different activities in order to maximize some objective.
    
7.  The Facility Location Problem: This LP problem involves finding the optimal location for a facility (such as a factory or warehouse) in order to minimize costs or maximize profits.
    
8.  The Knapsack Problem: This LP problem involves finding the optimal selection of items to include in a knapsack, in order to maximize the total value of the items while staying within the knapsack's weight limit.
