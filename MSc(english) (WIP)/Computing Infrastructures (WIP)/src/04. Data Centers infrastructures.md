A high-performance data center WSC (Web-Scale Computing) must operate continuously at optimal conditions, requiring efficient and reliable power delivery and building infrastructure.

## Cooling

Cooling usually requires about half the energy required by the IT equipment (servers + network + disks).

| Amortized Cost | Component | Sub-Components |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ∼45% | Servers | CPU, memory, disk |
| ∼25% | Infrastructure | UPS, cooling, power distribution |
| ∼15% | Power draw | Electrical utility costs |
| ∼15% | Network | Switches, links, transit |

Cooling topologies have tradeoffs in complexity, efficiency, and cost. The simplest cooling approach is fresh air cooling, which is efficient but not suitable for all climates, requires filtering of airborne particles, and may introduce complex control problems.
Two-loop systems are advantageous in terms of easy implementation and cost-effectiveness. They also provide protection against external pollutants. However, their operational efficiency is usually not as high as other systems.

3-loop system is expensive and has complex controls but provides good efficiency and contaminant protection. It is commonly used in large data centers.
