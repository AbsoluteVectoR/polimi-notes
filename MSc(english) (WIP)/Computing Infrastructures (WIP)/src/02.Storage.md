# Storage

SSD good for random reads but issues with random writes. 

HDD always more used in datacenters. 

often storage is a bottleneck


Disks can be seen by an OS as a collection of  
data blocks that can be read or written independently. 

- To allow the ordering/management among them, each block is characterized by a unique numerical address called LBA (Logical Block Address). 
- Typically, the OS groups blocks into clusters to simplify the access to the disk. Clusters, which can range from 1 disk sector (512 B) to 128 sectors (64 KB), are the minimal unit that an OS can read from or write to a disk. 

Clusters contains: 

- File data
- Meta data:
	- File names  
	- Directory structures and symbolic links  
	- File size and file type  
	- Creation, modification, last access dates  
	- Security information (owners, access list, encryption)  
	- Links to the LBA where the file content can be located on the disk

Since the file system can only access clusters, the real occupation of space on a disk for a file is always a multiple of the cluster size.

$$\text{actual size on disk}= ceil (\frac{\text{the file size}}{\text{the cluster size}})*\text{the cluster size}$$

The waste of space is called internal fragmentation of files.
$$\text{waste disk space} = \text{actual size on disk} - \text{file size}$$

Deleting a file never actually deletes the data on the disk: when a new file will be written on the same clusters, the old data will be replaced by the new one.

As the life of the disk evolves, there might not be enough space to store a file contiguously. In this case, the file is split into smaller chunks that are inserted into the free clusters spread over the disk. The effect of splitting a file into non-contiguous clusters is called external fragmentation. As we will see, this can reduce a lot the performance of an HDD.

HDD 

An HDD consists of one or more rigid ("hard") rotating disks (platters) with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm to read and write data to the surfaces.

Drive geometry  
§ Sectors arranged into tracks  
§ A cylinder is a particular track on multiple platters  
§ Tracks arranged in concentric circles on platters  
§ A disk may have multiple, double-sided platters

To understand well this: 

Externally, hard drives expose a large number of sectors (blocks)  
§ Typically 512 or 4096 bytes  
§ Individual sector writes are atomic  
§ Have a header and an error correction code  
§ Multiple sectors writes may be interrupted (torn write)

The external track are "faster" to read since angular velocity considerations and are more dense. 

Four types of delay  
1. Rotational Delay :Time to rotate the desired sector to the read head related to RPM 2 $T_{rotation}=\frac{R_{period}}{2}$ with $R_{period}=\frac{1}{RPM}$
2. Seek delay: Time to move the read head to a different track $T_{\text{seek AVG}}=\frac{T_{\text{seek MAX}}}{3}$ 
3. Transfer time: average time for a request (write or read) $T_{I/O}=T_{seek}+T_{rotation}+T_{transfer}+T_{overhead}$. Or, considering data locality: $T_{I/O}=(1-DL)(T_{seek}+T_{rotation})+T_{transfer}+T_{overhead}$.
4. Controller Overhead: Overhead for the request management
