Dependability refers to the ability of a system to perform its intended functionality while also exposing several key properties, including:

-   Reliability: Continuity of correct service
-   Availability: Readiness for correct service
-   Maintainability: Ability for easy maintainance
-   Safety: Absence of catastrophic consequences
-   Security: Confidentiality and integrity of data


## Reliability 

$R(t)$ = probability that the system will operate correctly in a specified operating environment until time $t$. 

In other terms: $R(t) = P(\text{not failed during }[0, t])$ assuming it was operating at time $t = 0$.

### Reliability Block Diagrams

An inductive model where a system is divided into blocks that represent distinct elements such as components or subsystems (each with its own reliability).

Serie:
$$R_s = R_a*R_b*...R_n$$
Parallel:
$$R_p=1-(1-R_a)*(1-R_b)*...(1-R_n)$$


#### RooN

A system having one primary replica and n redundant replicas (with identical replicas and perfect switching).

$$R(t)=e^{-\lambda t} \sum ^{n-1}_{i=0}\frac{(\lambda t)^i}{i!}$$

#### Triple Modular Redundancy - TMR

So for short time horizon you are increasing the realibity but when the time goes on the probability of failures is greater since there are more components: the more components you add the higher will be the probability of failures at the limit of infinite of time.

It depends on the time horizon. There is always a point in time where the reliability of basic components are more realiable than any kind of rendundancy. 
And this point in time is: 

$$t = \frac{ln2}{\lambda _m}$$ 
$RTMR(t) > RC(t)$ when the mission time is shorter than $70\%$ of $MTTF$. So it's always important to know the goal and the length of the mission time to make correctly rendundant systems. 

## Availability 

$A(t)$: probability that the system will be operational at time $t$

Fundamentally different from reliability since it admits the possibility of brief outages. Availability is a second point of view: 
- reliability: "does not break down ..."  
- availability: "even if it breaks down, it's working when  
needed ..."

| Availability | System      |                   |
| ------------:|:----------- |:----------------- |
|          99% | ~ 4 days     | Generic web site  |
|        99.9% | ~ 9 hours     | Amazon.com        |
 |       99.99% | ~ 1 hour     | Enterprise server |
|      99.999% | ~ 5 minutes  | Telephone system  |
|     99.9999% | ~ 30 seconds | Phone switches                  |


[Same definitions seen in Software Engineering 2](03.Availability.md) :

- Mean Time To Failures ($MTTF$): time between the recovery from one incident and the occurrence of the next incident, also known as up-time. 
- Mean Time Between Failures ($MTBF$): Mean time between the occurrences of two consecutive incidents

$$M T T F=\int_0^{\infty} R(t) d t$$
$$MTBF=\frac{\text{total operating time}}{\text{number of failures}}$$

sometimes we also use failure rate $\lambda=\frac{\text{number of failures}}{\text{total operating time}}$ .



$$A = \frac{MTTF}{(MTTF+MTTR)}$$
