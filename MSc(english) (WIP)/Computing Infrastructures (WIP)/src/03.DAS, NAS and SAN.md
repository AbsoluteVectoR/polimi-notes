| Number | Domain  and Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | 
| DAS (Direct Attached Storage)  |  Suitability for budget and constraint-heavy environments. Simple storage solutions  |  Limited accessibility  and scalability. No central management or backup |
| NAS (Network Attached Storage)  |  File storage and sharing and big data storage. Scalability  and greater accessibility   |  Increased LAN traffic, performance limitations and security and reliability concerns |
| SAN (Storage Area Network)  |  Suitable for DBMS and virtualized environments, have best performance, best scalability  and best availability  |  High costs |

- A Direct Attached Storage (DAS): A DAS is a storage system directly connected to a server or workstation and appears as disks/volumes to the client operating system.
- A Network Attached Storage (NAS): a computer connected to a network that offers file-based data storage services such as FTP, Network File System, and SAMBA to other devices on the network. It appears as a File Server to the client OS.
- Storage Area Networks (SAN): Remote storage units are connected to PCs via networking technologies such as Fiber Channel and appear as disks/volumes on the client's OS.

## NAS vs SAN 

San (Storage Area Network) has a dedicated network for accessing storage devices.

- NAS provides storage and file system, while SAN only provides block-based storage.
- NAS is seen as a file server by the client OS, while SAN appears as a disk.
- NAS is used for low-volume access by many users, while SAN is used for petabytes of storage and simultaneous file access, like audio/video streaming.
