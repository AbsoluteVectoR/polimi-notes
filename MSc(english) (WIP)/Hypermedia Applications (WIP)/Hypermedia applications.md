Usability 

usability is the measure of the effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction when we specify users can achieve a specified goal in particular environment.


broad-concept but in this course… We will embrace the functional view of usability, focusing on simplicity and ease of use

What to measure for usability

Which system features to focus on

Where to measure usability?


- Usability experts only
	• Method: Inspection or Experts’review
	• Heuristics-based: Verifying compliance with usability quality principles
- End users 
	• Method: User Testing: Usability properties are assessed by observing how the system is actually used by some representatives of real users. User behaviors are observed, recorded, and then analyzed by researchers (eye tracking). (User testing for Usability Evaluation is an example of EMPIRICAL Research Empirical Research = Gaining knowledge through facts)
	• Task-oriented: Users observed while “Doing things” with the application

User testing: 

parameters : time and tasks. 

Can users complete the expected tasks?
• Can they do it in acceptable times?
• What difficulties do they encounter?
• What is their perception of these difficulties?


Define user profiles and user goals to segment your target audience and recruit users


Data Gathering: Variables

Define the usability variables to measure
• Quantitative indicators:
• Effectiveness (task success rate)
• Efficiency (time on task)
• Errors (wrong paths or actions)
• Perceived tasks difficulty
• Qualitative indicators:
• Disorientation, stops, frustrations, waiting periods, wandering
periods
• Unexpected behaviors
• Satisfaction,
• Engagemen

Final step: Analysis and interpretation of collected data

After the data is organized (maybe using classification/clustering techniques) and analyzed using both **qualitative** and **quantitative** methods we will obtain results which should highlight the main problems.
From **problem reporting** we can identify recommendations for improvements, **prioritizing** by severity and impact.
