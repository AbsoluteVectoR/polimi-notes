Should I place all the PDFs in releases?

The content of all the spaces in this collection has been prepared by a student and may contain errors or omissions. It is intended to be used as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, the course material provided by the professors. The author and publisher of these notes makes no warranty of any kind, express or implied, with regard to the accuracy or completeness of these materials.


Main features: 

- These notes are here to help you to study better but are not perfect and often not complete (more info on chapter 3)
- Every topic of each courses is written in markdown and linked using Markdown links: this means it can be open in software like Obsidian (more info on chapter )
- Each course has also its associated PDF file, automatically generated running the .sh scripts in each folder or macro folder (more info on the chapter )
